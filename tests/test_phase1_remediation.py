Regression tests for Phase 1.1 Remediation Sprint.

Covers all six audit findings:
  Finding #1 — Defense fingerprint written back from classifier
  Finding #2 — Dict field reducers survive fan-in without silent overwrite
  Finding #3 — Curriculum stage 4 is reachable
  Finding #4 — Pattern miner produces output from session 1 (cold-start)
  Finding #5 — Schema freeze enforcement (export_schema.py --check)
  Finding #6 — RAG planner uses historical technique_stats from graph context
